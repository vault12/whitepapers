# Vault12 Whitepapers

## Zax Relays
  The Vault12 mobile network is enabled by _Zax_ nodes: digital "dead drops" designed for mobile machine-to-machine communications with unbreakable privacy. Each _Zax_ node is a [NaCl-based Cryptographic Relay](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/vault12/zax_infogfx.jpg).

## Decentralized Storage of Crypto Assets via Hierarchical Shamir's Secret Sharing
  In this paper, we describe a new cryptostorage platform that is based on hierarchical Shamir's secret sharing. This platform enables new security and storage models, which are designed specifically for owners of crypto assets. We will show how decentralized cryptography and a decentralized storage network come together to form infrastructure that protects cryptocurrencies with full owners control, complete privacy, reliability and high availability. Owners of crypto assets can quickly setup distributed Vaults that are highly resilient and impenetrable to attacks on any part of the cryptostorage infrastructure.
